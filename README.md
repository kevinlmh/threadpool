# An elegant thread pool implementation in C

## Features
* Simple and clean API
* Small filesize, just two files, easy to add to your project
* Well documented and readable code, easy to understand and to modify

## Usage
First of all, include threadpool.h in your project.
```
include "threadpool.h"
```
Then, create a threadpool with some number of threads.
```
threadpool_t *pool = threadpool_create(4);
```
Now you can add jobs to the threadpool.
```
threadpool_add_work(pool, some_job, args);
```
Finally, destroy the threadpool after you are done.
```
threadpool_destroy(pool);
```

## Compilation
This project is not precompiled. You should add both threadpool.c and threadpool.h to your project and compile them with your project. Don't forget to add -pthread when you compile this project since it uses pthreads. 
```
gcc -c threadpool.c -pthread
gcc myproject.o threadpool.o -o myproject
```
